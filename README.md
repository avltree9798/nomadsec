# NomadSec

## Wat?
A collaborative list of security companies, or companies for which infosec work is a large part of what they do, who are open to fully remote working. 'Two days from home' or 'flexible if you live nearby' doesn't count. 'Must fly out to the HQ for an orientation period' is fine, but please note it.

Got someone to add? Pull request or email sam@pizzey.me if you don't want to for some reason. Please try to match the format of the existing entries where possible. It's also alphabetical, so don't break that or my eyelids will twitch a lot and I hate it when that happens.
